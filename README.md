### What I learned

During my recent project, I had the opportunity to work with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the first time, a powerful build tool for web applications. It provided a seamless development experience with its fast and efficient development server.
Additionally, I leveraged the [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) DateTime object to manipulate time-related data, such as year, month, and day, which proved to be a reliable and user-friendly solution.
```install luxon
npm i luxon
```
However, one of the challenges I faced was displaying error text effectively. Despite this obstacle, I managed to overcome it and ensure that error messages were displayed appropriately.
